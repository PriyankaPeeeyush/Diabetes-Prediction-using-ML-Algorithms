# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML-Algorithms

Developed diabetes prediction model using Frankfurt and PIMA
data.

Explored data, pre-processed, and compared algorithms
(Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, RF, SVM, Adaptive Boosting,
Gradient Boosting, XG Boost).

Compared the results for both Frankfurt and PIMA datasets.
